# EDA on Chicago Crime Dataset

## Project Overview

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a crime dataset from Chicago. The aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the dataset. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) for the analysis, a CSV file containing the dataset, and a presentation summarizing the findings.

## Repository Contents

- **`crime_data.csv`**: The dataset used for the analysis.
- **`Chicago_Crime_EDA.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA.
- **`Chicago_Crime_EDA_Presentation.pdf`**: A presentation summarizing the key findings from the analysis.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
- **Data Visualization**: Using various plots and charts to visualize crime trends, patterns, and distributions.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performing basic statistical analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
- **Insights and Findings**: Highlighting significant observations and insights derived from the data.
